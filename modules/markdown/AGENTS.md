This module works on the results of the "combine" and "selection" modules.

The module uses the same output folder, named after the video, where the sqlite3 file resides. It creates a nested "img" folder there, to store the images that will be included in the documentation for the section.

The module writes all selected screenshots (original sizes) for any task into the "img" folder, naming each image file with its hash (as stored in the hash database). The original frames are always used regardless of selection settings.

The module then walks section by section, performing these tasks:

1. It feeds an LLM model the section, tasks, speech fragments and selections, as well as a summary of the previous sections. The prompt must:
  - Request the LLM to produce a tutorial / training style markdown document with the material in the section. The markdown can reference any jpg image in the img folder, using the image's hash as image name.
  - Stress that the selections have been provided by a small model and may contain inaccuracies, so the LLM should verify the content and correct any mistakes by giving higher priority to speech fragments and tasks over the selections.
  - Stress also that speech fragments have been generated by a small audio to text model and may contain typos, specially related to technical terms and abbreviations, so the LLM should verify and correct them as needed.
2. It then prompts the LLM again to summarize the markdown it just produced, in a brief 1-2 sentence summary, to be used as the summary of the section for the next section's context.
3. The module logs the summary produced by the LLM, and stores the markdown document for the section into markdown file named by section index (e.g., "section_0001.md", "section_0002.md", etc).
4. The module proceeds to the next section, until all sections have been processed.
5. Finally, the module produces a README.md file which contains a table of contents and a section for each summary with a link to the markdown file.
6. Before generating new output, the module removes the previous `img` folder and section markdown files in the per-video output folder.

The default model to use is gpt-oss:20b, with 32K of context and 32K of max output. A language setting controls the markdown and summary language.
